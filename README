AutomationExercise Regression Testing Project

This project automates key user journeys on AutomationExercise
 using Playwright with JavaScript. The goal is to ensure the website main features work correctly and reliably across browsers.

User Journeys Covered:

The tests focus on four important actions that most users perform:

User Registration -  Ensures new users can create accounts.

User Login / Logout - Confirms login and logout functionality.

Product Search - Verifies users can search for products and view results.

Add to Cart & View Cart - Checks that products can be added to the cart and displayed correctly.

These journeys cover core site functionality and critical business flows.

Framework & Language :

Framework: Playwright

Language: JavaScript

### Test Reports
Playwright generates HTML reports and test result files locally.  
These files are ignored via `.gitignore` and are not committed to the repository.

Reports can be generated and viewed locally using: npx playwright show-report

Password is managed using environment variables (`.env`) and are not committed to the repository. 
Example `.env` file format : TEST_USER_PASSWORD=your_password
